# Quantum Fluids

This repository collect all my personal approaches and codes of Bose-Einstein Condensates and, therefore, quantum fluids, wich are closely related. The main goal is to solve the time-dependent Non-Linear Schr√∂dinger equation, also called Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE) for a general interaction potential V(r).

Up to now, the codes are developed for 1D-GPE and 2D-GPE you can check the jupyter notebooks if desired and the theoretical derivation of the super hidrodynamical equations.
